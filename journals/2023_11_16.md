- When we return we find our heroes in an abandoned shack after a long well-deserved rest
	- [[Amie]] contacts [[Lark]] to say that some people are really mad about the rumors that the [[Party]] has killed [[Penmue saint of the written word]] that are spreading
		- [[Amie]] seems _suuuuppppeeerrrrr_ thrilled that we have essentially killed 2 gods
			- Personally [[Lark]] thinks this will be great PR for [[Det brændende sværd]] because who's going to mess with an organization that has taken down multiple gods?
		- [[Amie]] says that we should all meet in 3 weeks in [[Gammelstad]]
- We circle back towards the battlefield but [[Thrud]] and [[Jaylin]] get snuck up on by some albino orc hunters while [[Lark]] is scouting ahead
	- [[Lark]] sees them just in [[time]] to react but not in [[time]] for [[Jaylin]] and [[Thrud]] to not be surprised
	- [[Jaylin]] gets knocked unconscious on the first round
	- [[Thrud]] goes down right after
	- [[Lark]] manages to kill a little more than half of the attackers while [[Thrud]] and [[Jaylin]] are down for the count
		- He gives [[Jaylin]] his healing potion, but [[Jaylin]] is immediately knocked down again after doing nothing useful on his turn
		- This burns basically every single resource [[Lark]] has available to pull off
	- [[Thrud]] eventually bleeds out and dies
	- [[Jaylin]] miraculously (nat 20) gets back up
		- He heals himself and [[Lark]] back to a reasonable level of health
		- He then brings [[Thrud]] back to life with Revivify while [[Lark]] dispatches the remaining ork
	- A group of orcs armed with slings show up having been alerted by the noise and start shooting at the [[Party]]
		- They are at long range so they don't hit too well
	- A chase ensues and the [[Party]] is slowly getting some distance on the attackers when they use a horn to call for even more backup
	- The backup shows up a bit later in the form of 2 raptor riders and attack [[Jaylin]] who almost immediately goes down again
	- [[Thrud]] and [[Lark]] makes a heroic stand and manages (through lots of difficulty) to take down both riders and their mounts in 2 turns using every last resource and powerful magic they have remaining
	- [[Thrud]] stuffs the unconscious [[Jaylin]] into the bag of holding while [[Lark]] uses a healers kit to stabilize him - he'll be able to breathe in there for 10 min and won't bleed out anymore
	- The chase is about to resume, but the slingers have now caught back up to be in range to attack so it's going to be rough
