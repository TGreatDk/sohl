- Standing around the decapitated [[Jabberwocky]] corpse we start wondering why it was that we killed it?
	- It was something about needing the heart for something we believe, but we aren't sure what it was exactly
	- [[Lark]] suggest eating it to gain the power of the [[Jabberwocky]]
		- The others think that doesn't sound quite right but have no better suggestions
- We chop open the [[Jabberwocky]]'s chest cavity and free the heart
	- When [[Jaylin]] touches, the heart he's transported somewhere and leaves only a small puddle of freshwater behind

	- On the road there we have to dodge patrols with increasing frequency as we seem to be getting closer to [[The Bastion]]
