- Standing around the decapitated [[Jabberwocky]] corpse we start wondering why it was that we killed it?
	- It was something about needing the heart for something we believe, but we aren't sure what it was exactly
	- [[Lark]] suggest eating it to gain the power of the [[Jabberwocky]]
- We chop open the [[Jabberwocky]]'s chest cavity and frees the heart
	- When [[Jaylin]] touches, the heart he's transported somewhere and leaves only a small puddle of freshwater behind
		- He finds himself at the bottom of the lake inside [[Jabberwocky cave]] where he immediately panics because he can't swim, swallows a bunch of water and passes out
		- While passed out he sees a vision
