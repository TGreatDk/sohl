- We return to our heroes when they are still in the middle of the chase
	- The Orcs with slingers are still after them
	- They managed to knock down [[Thrud]] and with much struggle [[Lark]] manages to stabilize her and get her into the bag of holding where the unconscious [[Jaylin]] already is
	- Eventually [[M'Ork]] shows up as backup just as [[Lark]] is about to finally get away from the slingers
		- They manage to get away from the slingers together
		- After running for a while [[Thrud]] & [[Jaylin]] wakes up and leaves the bag
		- We decide to take a short rest to recover
			- The slingers show up just before we complete our rest - they have been following our tracks
			- We have hidden in the trees, but they can smell us
			- [[Thrud]] tries to distract them but it backfires and they know for sure that we are there
			- We jump them and manage to kill them all
		- We return to the hunting cabin and manage to take a rest
		- We decide to go looking for the old camp and [[Støvler McGuinnis]] so we can join back up with [[Boris]]
			- There's scouts there and [[Jaylin]] immediately tells them that we are from [[Det brændende sværd]] - the guards turn hostile on the due to a rumor that the [[Party]] has killed [[Penmue saint of the written word]]
			- The [[Party]] except [[Lark]] (He said his name is "Måv'ns" and he's just a random mushroom collector) is arrested and cuffed and escorted to go see [[Amie]] who's apparently here‽
			- When the [[Party]], and "Måv'ns" arrive at the small camp Løven hjerte's tent is there and [[Amie]] seems to be in there talking to him
			- [[Lark]] uses the sending stones to confirm that it is in fact the real [[Amie]] - it seems to be
			- Turns out that [[Amie]] has ratted out the [[Party]], and we see her getting paid to do so
				- She has darker hair since last we saw her, and there's another elf with her who [[Lark]] recognizes as possibly being [[Amie]]'s old mentor [[Osty]]
			- [[Amie]] doesn't blow [[Lark]]'s cover though, so maybe she's not entirely against the [[Party]]
				- She mentions something about "It was either me or you - and then it's you"
			- It sounds like there's going to be a trial in a few days where [[M'Ork]], [[Thrud]], and [[Jaylin]] will be tried and sentenced (probably to death) for their crime
				- The prosecution seems to be looking for a very specific person to preside over the case
