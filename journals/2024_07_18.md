- We run from a patrol of [[Black spheres]] but they track us
	- [[Thrud]] blows her magic horn and summon 15 **hostile** berserkers in a ring around us

		- [[Judtraine]] runs away and leaves [[Thrud]], [[Lark]] & [[Monngoo]] surrounded
		- [[Thrud]] uses a spell to create an opening and make a break for it
			- She immediately gets knocked unconscious
		- [[Monngoo]] breaks the magic horn and all except 2 of the berserkers vanish
		- [[Lark]] runs to [[Thrud]] and feeds her a potion to bring her back to consciousness
	- We manage to slay the berserkers and basically reset the whole thing back to what it was before the whole ting minus some time that our pursuers has caught up, our magic horn, a health potion, and some HP
	- We continue the escape and they continue pursuing
		- We try to lose them in a stream and follow it to a lake and cave that [[Imrik]] mentioned in his letter
		- We believe that the cave has a [[Jabberwocky]] like mentioned in the letter based on all the bones scattered around the entrance
