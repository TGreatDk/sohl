- [[Jaylin]] shows up with [[Whiro]] who has desserted from [[The Emperor]]'s army
	- We mange to somewhat hide from our pursuers
	- But people aren't very good at hiding so we get noticed
	- [[Whiro]] goes and pretends to still work for [[The Emperor]] and directs them to go to the cave
	- We move further away and hide to take a short rest
		- And then a long rest
		- During the night we hear flapping of huge wings
- [[Whiro]] has a letter that she was supposed to deliver to a guy named [[Rix]]
	- When she breaks the seal small sparks fly
	- The letter is coded and we will have to break the code
