- We walk back towards the [[Jabberwocky cave]] to check on the engineers that [[Whiro]] learned that was supposed to show up to flood the cave
	- When [[Lark]] scouts ahead to see if they have arrived he sees around maybe 20 corpses ripped to shreds and burned up
	- [[Lark]] promptly returns to the party and suggests we go do something else **very** far away from here
- [[Jaylin]] consults his magic sticks and they seem to show that attacking the [[Jabberwocky]] would likely go well - [[Lark]] is convinced that [[Thrud]] must have crafted the sticks incorrectly because that sounds insane
	- [[Jaylin]] casts "Arcane Eye" and sends it down into the [[Jabberwocky cave]] to scout it out
		- He finds a lake down there where the [[Jabberwocky]] is laying at the bottom
		- It notices the eye and stats rushing out of the cave

		- We start running but it immediately catches up to us and swoops down from the sky to attack us
		- It immediately spews a stream of fire which hits 3 of us and follows it up with a claw swipe that sends [[Jaylin]] to the ground where he lies unmoving
		- The Wocky Jabbers and causes [[Lark]] and [[Judtraine]] to behave erratically
		- [[Jaylin]] miraculously bounces back up to his feet and dodges a swipe from the foe
		- [[Whiro]] charges the beast and smites it with holy retribution
