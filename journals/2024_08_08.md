- We walk back towards the [[Jabberwocky cave]] to check on the engineers that [[Whiro]] learned that was supposed to show up to flood the cave
	- When [[Lark]] scouts ahead to see if they have arrived he sees around maybe 20 corpses ripped to shreds and burned up
	- [[Lark]] promptly returns to the party and suggests we go do something else **very** far away from here
