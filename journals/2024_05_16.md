- We Head towards where the [[Zoomer]] thing is supposed to be at
	- [[Zoomers]] turn out to be basically mag-lev trains that move incredibly fast
	- We take the [[Zoomer]] towards [[Vlorn]]
	- [[Vlorn]] has changed quite a bit, its a seemingly very rich place and has a huge temple and statue dedicated to [[The Emperor]]
	- We go looking for [[Kelvin]]'s shop
		- There's some kind of automaton/hologram who looks like an old [[Kelvin]] and the whole area seems to have been preserved as some sort of museum
			- Turns out that it was an actor not an automaton
	- We head to the old [[Penmue]] temple which is now a temple to [[The Emperor]]
