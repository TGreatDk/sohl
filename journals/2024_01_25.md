- We walk to the forest
	- Due east, we walk for a day
	- from the treetops we can see a town with a lot of smoke
	- We turn south and go towards it
	- We see a big and tall tower out in the middle of what looks like it could be a lake
	- We continue towards the town and encounter a river
		- By the river there's some statues of [[Gitbut]] farting in [[M'Ork]]'s face
		- We give the statue a diamond and a goblin comes out from a hole and parts the water for us so we can cross
	- We run into [[Thrud]] knocking on doors in the town
	- As we are catching up with [[Thrud]] a big black hole in the sky comes flying toward us from the horizon
		- [[Judtraine]] has some knowledge of them via rumors/legends
