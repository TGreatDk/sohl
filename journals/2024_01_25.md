- We walk to the forest
	- Due east, we walk for a day
	- from the treetops we can see a town with a lot of smoke
	- We turn south and go towards it
	- We see a big and tall tower out in the middle of what looks like it could be a lake
	- We continue towards the town and encounter a river
		- By the river there's some statues of [[Gitbut]] farting in [[M'Ork]]'s face
		- We give the statue a diamond and a goblin comes out from a hole and parts the water for us so we can cross
	- We run into [[Thrud]] knocking on doors in the town
	- As we are catching up with [[Thrud]] a big black hole in the sky comes flying toward us from the horizon
		- [[Judtraine]] has some knowledge of them via rumors/legends
			- They are supposedly dangerous
		- We go hide from the [[Black sphere]] in one of the houses
		- It gets very loud and we end up screaming and making some noise. The sphere reacts by blowing up some of the houses in the town
	- We find a small statue on the townsquare which depicts [[The emperor]] standing atop a pile of slain Orks
		- [[Lark]] pokes it with his sword to make sure that it's not dangerous, but when he does the [[Black sphere]] instantly shows up in the sky above us
		- It seems like incorporeal darkness with some spots that shot spells or other things at us
		- We escape into a house which turns out to have a basement room
		- There's a small tunnel down there
		- The tunnel connects to some other small cellar rooms
		- One part of the tunnel goes to the other side of the river where the [[Kitbut]] statues are
