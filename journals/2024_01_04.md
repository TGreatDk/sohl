- We wake up in a cave
	- [[Lark]] Knocks over the [[M'Ork]] statue
	- [[Thrud]] is nowhere to be found
	- There's a ton of other statues in the cave, but all of them except one are still
		- [[Judtraine]] is the other person who has woken up
			- She's an elf from a much later time
	- There's a bunch of different statues in here in different kinds of materials
	- We find a room with some people in it who seem to maybe be guards
		- They trigger an alarm and we kill them in response
		- We flee the scene as we hear something approaching
		- There's also a sound coming from the front now
		- We try to hide in a room, but we all suck and the automatas that are looking for us spot us
			- A fight ensues
