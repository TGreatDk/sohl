- We continue digging in the wall for a bit
	- [[Thrud]] eventually hits solid rock
- Meanwhile [[Lark]] goes downstairs to talk to the others and see Dandruf talking to someone called Vivian
	- Dandruf was just upstairs and it seems unlikely that he somehow passed [[Lark]] on the way down
	- Dandruf complains of some headaches like before so [[Lark]] goes to fetch [[Jaylin]] to check him out.
		- Upstairs Dandruf is watching [[Thrud]] digging
		- [[Jaylin]] goes downstairs with Dandruf who claims to not have any headaches and to never have mentioned any
		- They run into Vivian downstairs but no Dandruf
	- [[Lark]] goes down to check on them but on the way he notices a pair of boots sticking out from under a bed at the barracks level
		- It turns out to be Vivian who has a gaping hole in her chest and upon closer inspection seem to have been dead for a day or two
		- [[Lark]] shouts for help to alert the group since he just saw Vivian alive moments ago so something weird is going on
