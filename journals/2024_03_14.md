- We continue digging in the wall for a bit
	- [[Thrud]] eventually hits solid rock
- Meanwhile [[Lark]] goes downstairs to talk to the others and see [[Dandruf]] talking to someone called Vivian
	- [[Dandruf]] was just upstairs and it seems unlikely that he somehow passed [[Lark]] on the way down
	- [[Dandruf]] complains of some headaches like before so [[Lark]] goes to fetch [[Jaylin]] to check him out.
		- Upstairs [[Dandruf]] is watching [[Thrud]] digging
		- [[Jaylin]] goes downstairs with [[Dandruf]] who claims to not have any headaches and to never have mentioned any
		- They run into Vivian downstairs but no [[Dandruf]]
	- [[Lark]] goes down to check on them but on the way he notices a pair of boots sticking out from under a bed at the barracks level
		- It turns out to be Vivian who has a gaping hole in her chest and upon closer inspection seem to have been dead for a day or two
		- [[Lark]] shouts for help to alert the group since he just saw Vivian alive moments ago so something weird is going on
	- All the people gather and [[Dandruf]] initiates lockdown on instruction from [[The Party]]
		- Nobody can leave the underground levels now
		- [[The Party]] starts questioning the people to find the killer/imposter and realises that [[Dandruf]] was talking to Vivian while he was upstairs at the same time which makes it likely that both Vivian and that [[Dandruf]] were/are imposters so there's not one but maybe two or more imposters
		- [[Jaylin]] tries to speak with dead but it fails because someone else have used it on Vivian's corpse recently
		- Eventually we find a used scroll of Speak with Dead and a used scroll of Gentle Ripose
			- This indicates that the body has been preserved for 10 days which throws the entire timeline we had been working with right out the window
