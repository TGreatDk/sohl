- [[Lark]] successfully tricks the entire group into thinking he's brewing a potion to reveal who the impostors are
	- Everyone drinks it without hesitating but unexpectedly (because it is a fake potion) [[Thrud]] and Larsie starts glowing red
	- Since everyone is convinced it's real they all believe that [[Thrud]] & Larsie are the impostors
		- We construct a makeshift prison in the barracks to house them while we make a plan
	- During the night someone attacks the posted guards including [[Judtraine]] by first throwing a flask of some kind of darkness in through the door
		- Larsie is instantly dead
	- Some "battle" ensues where some movement is heard and something runs up the wall in the staircase shaft
		- Whatever is is seems to be invisible and manages to avoid capture by [[Lark]]
		- [[Jaylin]] counts all the people downstairs and they all seem to be there
		- After everything calms down again [[Jaylin]] casts "Speak with dead" and learns that Larsie had been held captive upstairs by two grey "creatures" one of who seem to have taken his place in the cell until he was replaced and killed in the cell
