	- The day passes
-
- The next day is Thursday
	- [[M'Ork]] & [[Lark]] returns to the inn named "Kroen uden navn"
	- [[Jaylin]] is outside asking where we were last night
		- [[Lark]] & [[M'Ork]] remembers being gone for weeks
	- [[Thrud]] is inside the inn
	- [[Amie]] responds to a message from [[Lark]] on the sending stones saying that she's "At the inn"
		- Turns out to _not_ be this inn in [[Vlorn]]
		- While walking towards "Den Røde Ganger" [[Lark]] spots something that looks like [[Oliver]]
			- He gives chase to the squirrel
				- It seems to not actually be [[Oliver]]
				- It has a rolled up piece of parchment
					- It is blank
					- A conversation between [[Lark]] & [[Amie]] transpires on the paper by way of writing and disappearing text
						-
					- The parchment crumbles
					- When [[Lark]] tries to talk to the squirrel it just makes pretend squirrel noises, but doesn't actually speak any sensible squirrel
					- The squirrel runs away up on the roof
						- [[Lark]] follows it up and keeps trying to talk to it
							- The squirrel keeps speaking nonsense and eventually runs further away and vanishes
						- From the roof it is obvious that people are leaving town to the North
						- A large host of people which is carrying the [[Gammelstad]] banner is moving North outside [[Vlorn]] seemingly also marching to war
							- Among the host is a wagon pulled by a [[Kiboku]]
								- We guess that it might be [[Boris]] and the new recruits
		- [[M'Ork]] talks to a stranger to figure out who everyone seems to be going to war with
			- They are heading north because the Saint told them that someone will try to invade across the sea from the West
			- Someone has set a fire in their northern most holding
				- This was likely [[M'Ork]] and [[Lark]] when they were in the past

	- We go to pick up our horses and steal the other [[Kiboku]] who claims to be called [[Doris]]
		- [[Doris]] is pretty dumb but we mange to get all the way over to the wagon which is indeed pulled by [[Boris]]
			- [[Boris]] got a watermelon as promised when he was picked up to go on the trip
		- [[Støvler McGuinnis]] is driving the wagon
			- He's a new recruit for [[Det brændende sværd]] who has been sent by [[Amie]]
