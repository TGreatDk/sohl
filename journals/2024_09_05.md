- [[Lark]] recovers [[Thrud]] from the grasp of the guy who's room she went to
- We sleep and prepare for tomorrow, the plan is for [[Lark]] to dress up as [[Judtraine]] and hide her in the bag of holding so we can be 3 people entering [[Rix]]'s office and then when we kill him we can pretend to be him when we leave 4 people from his office. We have to kill him because the letter we are giving him has a fake seal
	- When we go to have our meeting we learn that his 'office' is at the bottom of the huge pit in the centre of the courtyard
	- We get lowered down in the hole on a platform and near the bottom we encounter an anti-magic field
	- When we step off the platform the anti-magic field goes away
	- It's completely dark down here (normal darkness)
