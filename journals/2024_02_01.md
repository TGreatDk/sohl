- The goblin is called [[Garboo]]
	- He lives in a cave a good long walk away from the river filled with a bunch of other goblins
	- They have a big mud-bath and we pretty much get spa treatment
- The next day we leave the goblin cave and go towards the tower where we were once told [[Oswin]] lives
	- We make our way all the way to the edge of the glass dessert
