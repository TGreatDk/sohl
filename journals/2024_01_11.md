- The automatons drop concentration on the spell they are using to keep us trapped for just a moment
	- We try dashing through the door to escape
	- There's some more people outside the room that also seem to want to capture us
	- A fight ensues. [[Judtraine]] Does fuck all to help and just stands and watches
		- We win anyway - the humans were an illusion and [[Judtraine]] didn't do anything
	- We hear a hum from a room down the corridor
		- It's some sort of storage room
		- The hum seems to come from the huge ass portal in the room
			- There's some black and red stones in some crates that fit in some slots at the back of the portal frame which seem to control the portal in some way
		- We find a crate with some wanted posters- The wanted posters are dated 2 months before we were in the battle with the saints in the past
