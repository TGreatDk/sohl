- We go to the last resting place of [[The Bordeaux Knights]] that we visited back in the past
	- We can't find the entrance and try to locate it and notice that someone has been trying to hide their tracks here
	- [[Thrud]] uses detect magic to try to check if there are any illusions hiding the entrance but gets completely blinded by the immense aura shining from [[Jaylin]]
		- Once [[Jaylin]] walks away the aura fades and [[Thrud]] doesn't detect any unusual magic
		- While looking around some hunters come around the corner and starts asking all sorts of questions about who we are and what we are doing here
		- They "invite" us for dinner but we have to lead the way
	- The old cave is now lived in by these hunters and the murals have been painted all nice like
		- We have a long talk and a meal with them and figure out that we are in the year 2348
		- We came from the year 1347 ([[Judtraine]] is from 2137)
		- [[Dandruf Desmerette]] is the name of one of the hunters
	- The hidden back chamber seems used now and has Bordeaux capes on the walls
	- The emperor sometimes goes by the name Belios
	- We get shown to the basement which is a bunch of rooms this time where we will sleep for the night
