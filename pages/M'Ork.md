  M’ork was born in a large fishing town by the ocean, already at the age of 5 he started working as a cabin boy along with his brother Sh’all who is 2 years older than him on his father’s whaling ship. through the years they both became very competent sailors and a rivalry between them started growing.
  
  Through the years they got older and Sh’all got married. while M’ork started growing spiteful of his brother as they had both vied for the hand of the same woman. but one fateful day during a whale hunt there was an accident where M’ork was thrown off balance while throwing a harpoon and hit his brother with a fatal blow, shortly after M’ork married the now widowed wife of his brother and adopted their already 5 children.
  
  Over the years due to M’ork and his brother’s rivalry a rumor had started brewing in the town that the death of his brother was no accident but an act of malice. and that M’ork had intentionally killed him to get to marry his wife.
  
  Over the years M’ork grew tired of the stigma that had started to surround him with rumors so vulgar as to suggest he had been with a bear and sought out a new life with his friend [[Kurt]], a drinking buddy he had spent many nights at the local pub with, and they drew to the city of Gammelby and joined with the mercenary company of det brændene sværd. seeking the glory of the riches from adventuring
