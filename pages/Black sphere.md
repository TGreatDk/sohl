- The black spheres started appearing around the time of the Battle for Gammelstad. At first only a single or maybe two were seen at a time, but as the battles started turning in favour of #[[The Emperor]] and their forces, more were seen at once, leading to the main battle for Gammelstad where people reported seeing upwards of fifty in a single location.
- After the invasion was defeated, the black spheres have not been seen since, leading to a great many people thinking the black spheres were never real, and simply a metaphor, or a name of a grouping / regiment.
